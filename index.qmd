# Hi, welcome to my personal website!

My name is Amber Fredenburg. I am currently a PhD Candidate at The Ohio State University in Dr. Karen Goodell's lab studying native ground-nesting bee ecology and conservation. I hope to graduate with my PhD in Spring 2027! I earned my B.Sc. in Zoology from The Ohio State University in 2018 and a M.Sc. in Forestry from Lakehead University in 2020. 

My research interests span ecology and entomology, with an emphasis on conservation. I am passionate about understanding how we can support ecosystems, and all the species within them, to live and thrive in our human-dominated world. The projects I have been involved in range from large-scale surveys of Ohio's bees (the first in the state!) to small-scale nesting habitat enhancements in urban parks. I have spent much of my time as a researchers developing a deep understanding of native bees, including skills to identify species, but as an ecologist I am also interested in pollinators as a whole, the plants they pollinate, and the other biotic and abiotic factors these species interact with daily. 

On this website, you will find details of my research, published works, and mentorship. I will be regularly updating about my research progress and latest work.
