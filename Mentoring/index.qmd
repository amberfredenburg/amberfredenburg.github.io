She continued to work with the Goodell Lab throughout the summer, driving across the state to find rare specialist bees. Abby has a passion for insects and a deep interest in science and was inspired to continue working in research.

Noma is a current EEOB Masters student at Ohio State University. They first began working with me in 2022 on the Specialist Bee Project. They helped me investigate the nesting habitat of two specialist species and the bee community. They also traveled across the state to survey the hosts of specialist bees. After graduating in 2023 with a degree in Entomology, they were admitted into the graduate program at Ohio State and started working alongside me in the Goodell Lab. Their research focuses on Andrena geranii, a Hydrophyllum specialist, and how its population is influenced by sandy soil.
